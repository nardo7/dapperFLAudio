This repository is the official implementation of [**DapperFL: Domain Adaptive Federated Learning
with Model Fusion Pruning for Edge Devices**]. (Accepted by **NeurIPS 2024**)

## Requirements

To install requirements first install miniconda and afterwards:

```setup
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

We use <a href="https://wandb.ai/">wandb</a> to keep a log of our experiments.
If you don't have a wandb account, just install it and use it as offline mode.

### Datasets
#### Digits
In principle you do not need to download the datasets yourself. The only exception is syn which can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/synthetic-digits/data)

[//]: # (>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to set up the environment, e.g. pip/conda/docker commands, download datasets, etc...)

## Training & Evaluation

To train the model(s) in the paper, run this command:
```train
python ./fedml_experiments/standalone/domain_generalization/main.py \
       --model dapperfl 
       --dataset fl_officecaltech 
       --backbone resnet18
```

[//]: # (>ðŸ“‹  Describe how to train the models, with example commands on how to train the models in your paper, including the full training procedure and appropriate hyperparameters.)

## Arguments

You can modify the arguments to run DapperFL on other settings. The arguments are described as follows:
